                  <h2>Résumé</h2>
                  <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful
                    like me.
                    Romney &mdash; I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my
                    IQ is one of the highest &mdash; and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid
                    or insecure, it's
                    not
                    your fault.

                          however some of these
                          ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25

                          if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very
                          expensive to
                          be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a
                          manager,
                          because she is another Trump!
